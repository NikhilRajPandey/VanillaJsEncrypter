# Encrypter - VanillaJS

This is a project for the beginners in javascript programming and the project is made completely using client side javascript (also called Vanilla JavaScript). The tool (web page) here does the basic string encryption using a password (string). There is a text field where we can enter the text which we either want to encrypt or decrypt, and then we enter the password for the process, and finally click the encrypt or the decrypt button as per our choice. The result of the encryption or the decryption is shown at the result textarea.
